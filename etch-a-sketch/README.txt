This project is my edition of the etch a sketch task on the odin project. 

Here is a link to the task https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch. 

I let this be a rectangle, just to make it a little bit bigger and also fit better on a smartphone. I was looking in to the idea to make it "touch ready", but that would be a little ahead of the scope of this test. I might return to this game and make it work better, and also include a database to sore what you have drawn. This will be something I let my daughter play with, and it really was a fun one.
